A collection of genes that affect neurodevelopment of the creature. Below is a table with some key regions to demonstrate the concept.

| Brain Region          | Affects                              | Small Region                        | Large Region                         | Key Co-Interactions                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Prefrontal Cortex** | Executive control, planning capacity | Impulsive, reactive, poor foresight | Strategic, controlled, slower to act | Modulates **Amygdala**, **Basal Ganglia**       |
| **Hippocampus**       | Learning & memory throughput         | Slow learner, forgetful             | Fast learner, good navigation        | Boosts **Basal Ganglia** skill learning         |
| **Amygdala**          | Threat sensitivity                   | Under-reacts, fearless to fault     | Hyper-reactive, stress-prone         | Split by **Prefrontal Cortex** strength         |
| **Basal Ganglia**     | Habit formation & skill automation   | Clumsy, inconsistent                | Efficient, repetitive, rigid         | Feeds from **Hippocampus**, governed by **PFC** |
| **Cerebellum**        | Motor precision & timing             | Sloppy movement                     | High dexterity, fine control         | Enhances **Basal Ganglia** execution            |
| **Temporal Lobes**    | Pattern & signal interpretation      | Poor communication                  | Language, recognition                | Works with **Hippocampus**                      |
| **Parietal Lobes**    | Sensory integration                  | Disoriented                         | High awareness                       | Feeds **PFC** decisions                         |


More developed brains leads to a higher caloric cost and longer development times.

Hippocampus could affect memory capacity, which can be treated like blocks. We can have systems that prioritise what is memorised, such as food/water locations, known threats, foods to avoid or seek out. Maybe a basic knowledge graph system for sorting information could be powerful.

Aggression gene could be superseded by amygdala.

Cerebellum could affect movement and action speeds.

Temporal lobes could allow scent and sound signals to be learned and recognised, allowing creatures and plants to develop basic communication.

Parietal lobes could affect a creatures ability to filter sensory information, such as sight, sound, and smells. A highly developed parietal lobe could allow a hunter to sniff out prey even when the scent layer is crowded for example.

Capacity gene could increase overall ND budget available at a cost to maintenance budget and development time. Each gene controls what percentage of the overall budget it gets, so they all balance each other out.
