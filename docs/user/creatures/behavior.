# Creature Behavior

Creatures make decisions every moment based on their current needs and environment. Understanding these behavior patterns helps you predict what they'll do next.

---

## Motivations and Actions

Creatures have a two-level behavior system:

1. **Motivation** - What the creature *wants* (their goal)
2. **Action** - What the creature is *doing* (their current activity)

### Motivations

At any moment, a creature has one of these **motivations**:

| Motivation | Icon | What They Want |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **Hungry** | 🍖 | Need food |
| **Thirsty** | 💧 | Need water |
| **Amorous** | 💕 | Looking for a mate |
| **Tired** | 💤 | Need rest |
| **Content** | 🧭 | No urgent needs |

### Actions

While pursuing their motivation, creatures perform various **actions**:

| Action | What You'll See |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Searching** | Looking around for something |
| **Navigating** | Moving toward a target |
| **Eating** | Consuming meat or corpse |
| **Grazing** | Eating plants |
| **Drinking** | At water, replenishing |
| **Hunting** | Predator seeking prey |
| **Chasing** | Active pursuit |
| **Attacking** | Combat in progress |
| **Fleeing** | Running from danger |
| **Courting** | Seeking mate via scent |
| **Mating** | Breeding in progress |
| **Resting** | Recovering energy |
| **Wandering** | Exploring with no goal |

## How Creatures Choose Their Motivation

Every tick, creatures evaluate their needs and pick the most urgent one:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   DECISION CYCLE                     │
│                                                      │
│   Check Hunger ──► Above threshold? ──► HUNGRY      │
│        │                                             │
│        ▼                                             │
│   Check Thirst ──► Above threshold? ──► THIRSTY     │
│        │                                             │
│        ▼                                             │
│   Check Fatigue ─► Above threshold? ──► TIRED       │
│        │                                             │
│        ▼                                             │
│   Check Mate ────► Above threshold? ──► AMOROUS     │
│        │                                             │
│        ▼                                             │
│   Default ───────────────────────────► CONTENT      │
│                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **thresholds** are determined by genes! This means:
- Some creatures get "hungry" earlier than others
- Some can ignore thirst longer
- Some breed more frequently

---

## Hungry Motivation 🍖

When hungry, creatures search for food based on their diet:

### Herbivores
- **Action: Searching** → Looking for plants within sight range
- **Action: Navigating** → Moving toward nearest edible plant
- **Action: Grazing** → Consuming plants to gain energy

### Carnivores
- **Action: Searching** → Looking for prey within sight range
- **Action: Hunting** → Spotted prey, moving to engage
- **Action: Chasing** → Pursuing fleeing prey
- **Action: Attacking** → Combat with prey
- **Action: Eating** → Consuming killed prey or corpse

### Omnivores
- Can eat both plants and prey
- Opportunistic - takes whatever is closest
- Flexible survival strategy

### What You'll See

| Behavior | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Direct movement | Found food, heading toward it (Navigating) |
| Spiral pattern | Searching for food |
| Sudden acceleration | Prey fleeing OR predator pursuing (Chasing) |
| Stopping near plant | Grazing |

### The Hunt

When a carnivore spots prey:

```
PREDATOR                           PREY
    │                               │
    │ ──── Spots prey ────────────► │
    │      (Hunting)                │
    │                               │
    │ ◄──────────────── Detects danger
    │                    (Fleeing)  │
    │                               │
    │ ◄═══ CHASE BEGINS ══════════► │
    │      (Chasing vs Fleeing)     │
    │      (speed vs speed)         │
    │                               │
    ▼                               ▼
 Success: Eating            Escape: Survives
 Failure: Hungry still      Caught: Death
```

**Who wins the chase?** It depends on:
- **Speed** (locomotion gene)
- **Flee distance** (how early prey detects danger)
- **Pursue distance** (how far predator will chase)
- **Navigation** (pathfinding ability)

---

## Thirsty Motivation 💧

When thirsty, creatures search for water:

1. **Action: Searching** → Scan for water tiles within sight range
2. **Action: Navigating** → Move toward nearest water
3. **Action: Drinking** → At water, replenishing hydration

> 🌊 **Water tiles** are blue tiles in the world, usually near low elevations.

### What You'll See
- Creatures heading toward blue areas (Navigating)
- Brief pause at water's edge (Drinking)
- Return to other activities afterward

---

## Amorous Motivation 💕

The breeding system is one of EcoSim's most complex behaviors!

### Finding a Mate

Amorous creatures use **scent trails**:

```
                    SCENT TRAIL
     💕 ─────────────────────────────────
         │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │
         stronger ─────────► weaker

Other creature detects scent and follows gradient toward source
```

**Action sequence:**
1. **Courting** → Depositing scent, searching for scent trails
2. **Navigating** → Following scent toward potential mate
3. **Mating** → Both creatures together, reproduction occurring

See **[[scent-communication.md|Scent and Communication]]** for the full scent system!

### Mating Requirements

Both creatures must:
- ✅ Be amorous (looking for mate)
- ✅ Have enough energy
- ✅ Be genetically compatible (but not too similar)
- ✅ Meet in the same location

### Genetic Compatibility

Creatures prefer mates that are:
- **Similar enough** to be compatible
- **Different enough** for healthy offspring

This creates a "Goldilocks zone" of mate preference!

### What You'll See

| Behavior | What's Happening |
|----------|------------------|
| Wandering while amorous | Depositing scent, looking for scent (Courting) |
| Sudden direction change | Detected a scent trail |
| Following another creature | Found a potential mate (Navigating) |
| Brief pause with another | Mating occurring |
| New small creature appears | Offspring born! |

---

## Tired Motivation 💤

When fatigue gets too high, creatures must rest:

### What Happens During Rest

- **Action: Resting** → Creature stops moving
- Energy slowly recovers
- Fatigue decreases
- Vulnerable to predators!

### The Risk of Resting

Resting creatures can't flee quickly. Predators may:
- Spot resting prey more easily
- Catch them before they can escape

This creates selection pressure for:
- High fatigue tolerance (rest less often)
- Quick recovery (short rest periods)
- Safe resting spots (near allies, away from predators)

### What You'll See
- Creature stops moving (Resting action)
- No motivation changes for several ticks
- Gradual energy bar recovery

---

## Content Motivation 🧭

When no urgent needs exist, creatures explore:

### Content Behavior
- **Action: Wandering** → Move in generally consistent direction
- Occasional random direction changes
- Explores new territory
- May find new food sources or mates

### Why Wandering Matters

Content creatures help:
- Escape overpopulated areas
- Find unexploited resources
- Spread genes across the world
- Avoid local predators

---

## Watching Behavior Evolution

Over generations, you may notice behavior changes:

### Herbivore Adaptations
- **Sight range** increases (spot plants earlier)
- **Flee distance** increases (escape predators sooner)
- **Navigation** improves (efficient food-finding)

### Carnivore Adaptations
- **Pursue distance** increases (longer chases)
- **Speed** increases (catch prey)
- **Hunger threshold** optimizes (hunt at right times)

### General Adaptations
- **Mate threshold** shifts based on food availability
- **Fatigue tolerance** increases (less vulnerable resting)
- **Metabolism** optimizes for environment

---

## Try This! 🔬

### Experiment: Motivation Frequency

1. Select a creature with Inspector (F5)
2. Note its starting motivation
3. Count how many times each motivation appears over 5 minutes
4. Compare with another creature of different generation

You might see evolved creatures spending more time in productive motivations!

### Experiment: Predator Stalking

1. Find a carnivore
2. Watch its hunting attempts (look for Hunting → Chasing → Attacking actions)
3. Track: Attempts vs. Successes
4. Compare with the genes of prey it catches vs. prey that escapes

This reveals the selection pressure driving evolution!

### Experiment: Breeding Patterns

1. Watch a high-population area
2. Note breeding pairs that form (both showing Amorous motivation)
3. Use Inspector to compare their colors
4. Are similar colors breeding together?

This shows **assortative mating** in action!

## Common Questions

### Why does this creature keep changing direction?

Possible reasons:
- **Low navigation gene** - poor pathfinding
- **Multiple targets** - switching between detected food/mates
- **Conflicting needs** - thirst and hunger both high
- **Fleeing** - detecting threats from multiple directions

### Why won't two amorous creatures mate?

Check:
- Are they close enough? (must be on same/adjacent tile)
- Do they have enough energy?
- Is genetic compatibility in the "good" range?
- Is one fleeing from the other? (predator/prey)

### Why do some creatures never seem to rest?

They might have:
- **High fatigue threshold** - can go longer without rest
- **Low metabolism** - doesn't tire quickly
- **Constantly finding food** - replenishing energy

### What's the difference between Motivation and Action?

- **Motivation** = *Why* - what the creature wants (Hungry, Thirsty, etc.)
- **Action** = *What* - what the creature is doing right now (Searching, Eating, etc.)

A hungry creature might be Searching for food, then Navigating to it, then Eating it - the motivation stays Hungry, but the action changes!
