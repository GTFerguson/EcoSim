# Genetics Guide

Understanding how genetics works in EcoSim.

## Overview

Every living thing in EcoSim has a **genome** - a complete set of genetic instructions. The genome is organized into **chromosomes**, each containing related **genes**.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Gene | A single instruction (like "eye color" or "running speed") |
| Allele | A specific version of a gene (you have two per gene) |
| Genome | All of an organism's genes together |
| Phenotype | The actual traits you can observe |
| Expression | How strongly a gene is "turned on" |

## Guides

## The Big Picture

```
Genes → Expression → Phenotype → Behavior → Survival → Reproduction
```

Genes that help an organism survive get passed on. Over generations, this shapes entire species.

## How Traits Are Affected

An organism's traits aren't just determined by genetics—they're also influenced by:

- **🌡️ Environment** — Temperature, time of day, and humidity all affect trait expression
- **💪 Health** — Injured organisms may have reduced metabolic efficiency
- **⚡ Energy** — Some traits require energy to maintain
- **😴 Fatigue** — Tired creatures move slower but still keep their physical traits

Not all traits are affected equally! Physical structure (like teeth and hide) stays constant, while performance traits (like speed and perception) vary with the organism's condition. See the [genes guide](genes.md#-how-traits-are-affected) for details.
