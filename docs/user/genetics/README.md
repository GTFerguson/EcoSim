# Genetics Guide

Understanding how genetics works in EcoSim.

## Overview

Every living thing in EcoSim has a **genome** - a complete set of genetic instructions. The genome is organized into **chromosomes**, each containing related **genes**.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| Gene | A single instruction (like "eye color" or "running speed") |
| Allele | A specific version of a gene (you have two per gene) |
| Genome | All of an organism's genes together |
| Phenotype | The actual traits you can observe |
| Expression | How strongly a gene is "turned on" |

## Guides

## The Big Picture

```
Genes → Expression → Phenotype → Behavior → Survival → Reproduction
```

Genes that help an organism survive get passed on. Over generations, this shapes entire species.
