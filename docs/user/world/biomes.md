# World Biomes

EcoSim features **22 distinct biomes** based on the Whittaker classification system. Each biome has unique temperature, moisture, and environmental characteristics that affect which creatures and plants can survive there.

---

## Understanding Biomes

A **biome** is a climate zone with characteristic plant and animal life. In EcoSim, biomes are determined by two factors:

- **Temperature** - How hot or cold the region is
- **Moisture** - How wet or dry the region is

The combination of these creates a unique environment!

## Biome Categories

### 🌊 Aquatic Biomes

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Deep Ocean** | Variable | 100% | Open water - land creatures cannot enter |

**What Lives Here:** Fish in future updates. Currently uninhabitable by land creatures.

### ❄️ Cold Biomes

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Ice Cap** | Below -10°C | Any | Permanent ice and snow |
| **Tundra** | -10°C to 0°C | Low-Medium | Frozen ground, sparse vegetation |
| **Boreal Forest** | -5°C to 10°C | Medium | Coniferous trees, cold winters |
| **Cold Desert** | -10°C to 5°C | Very Low | Frozen but dry |
| **Glacier** | Below -20°C | Medium | Moving ice sheets |

**Typical Plants:**
- Hardy grasses, lichens
- Conifers (spruce, pine)

| **Temperate Deciduous** | 0°C to 25°C | Medium | Seasonal leaf-shedding trees |
| **Temperate Grassland** | -5°C to 25°C | Low-Medium | Prairie, steppe |
| **Temperate Desert** | 0°C to 30°C | Very Low | Hot days, cold nights |

**Typical Plants:**
- Deciduous trees (oak, maple)
- Grasses, wildflowers
- Moderate berry bushes

**Creature Adaptations Needed:**
- Moderate temperature tolerance
- Ability to handle seasonal changes
- Varied diet capabilities

### 🌴 Warm Biomes

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Tropical Rainforest** | 20°C to 35°C | Very High | Dense, hot, wet jungle |
| **Tropical Seasonal** | 20°C to 35°C | High | Wet and dry seasons |
| **Monsoon Forest** | 20°C to 35°C | High | Heavy seasonal rains |
| **Swamp** | 15°C to 30°C | Very High | Waterlogged lowlands |

**Typical Plants:**
- Fast-growing vegetation
- Abundant fruit trees
- Dense undergrowth

**Creature Adaptations Needed:**
- High temperature tolerance (above 25°C)
- Ability to handle humidity
- Often frugivore diets available

### 🏜️ Dry Biomes

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Desert** | 25°C to 50°C | Very Low | Hot, dry, sparse life |
| **Savanna** | 20°C to 35°C | Low-Medium | Grassland with scattered trees |
| **Shrubland** | 15°C to 30°C | Low | Drought-resistant bushes |
| **Semi-Arid** | 15°C to 35°C | Low | Transition zone |

**Typical Plants:**
- Cacti (water storage)
- Drought-resistant grasses
- Thorny shrubs

**Creature Adaptations Needed:**
- High temperature tolerance
- Low water requirements
- Ability to travel to water sources

---

### 🏔️ Alpine Biomes

| Biome | Temperature | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Alpine Tundra** | -10°C to 5°C | Low | High mountain cold |
| **Alpine Meadow** | 0°C to 15°C | Medium | Mountain grasslands |
| **Montane Forest** | 5°C to 20°C | Medium-High | Mountain forests |
| **Highland** | 5°C to 25°C | Variable | Elevated plateaus |

**Typical Plants:**
- Alpine grasses
- Stunted trees
- Cold-hardy flowers

**Creature Adaptations Needed:**
- Wide temperature tolerance
- Strong locomotion (climbing)
- Efficient oxygen use

---

## Biome Boundaries (Ecotones)

Where biomes meet, you'll find **transition zones** called ecotones. These areas:

- Blend characteristics of both biomes
- May have unique species diversity
- Temperature and moisture change gradually

### Example Transitions

| From | To | Transition Zone |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Desert | Savanna | Semi-arid scrubland |
| Tundra | Boreal | Sparse treeline |
| Rainforest | Seasonal | Drier forest edges |

---

## Biome Effects on Gameplay

### Plant Growth

| Biome Type | Plant Growth | Berry Production |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Tropical Rainforest | Very Fast | Abundant |
| Temperate Forest | Moderate | Moderate |
| Desert | Slow | Rare |
| Tundra | Very Slow | Minimal |

### Creature Survival

| Factor | Favorable Biome | Challenge |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Food Abundance** | Rainforests | Deserts |
| **Temperature** | Temperate zones | Extremes |
| **Water Access** | Swamps, wetlands | Deserts |
| **Cover/Hiding** | Forests | Grasslands |

## Recognizing Biomes Visually

### Color Guide

| Color | Likely Biome |
|-------|--------------|
| **Dark Green** | Rainforest, Dense Forest |
| **Light Green** | Grassland, Meadow |
| **Yellow-Green** | Savanna, Dry Grassland |
| **Yellow/Tan** | Desert, Semi-Arid |
| **White/Light Gray** | Ice, Tundra |
| **Blue** | Water |
| **Brown/Gray** | Mountains, Rocky |

### Temperature Indicators

- **Cold biomes:** Lighter, whiter tones
- **Hot biomes:** Yellower, browner tones
- **Wet biomes:** Darker, richer greens

## Biome Diversity Tips

### For Creature Success

1. **Stay in your comfort zone** - Match your creature's temperature tolerance to the biome
2. **Watch transitions** - Biome edges can be dangerous for unprepared creatures
3. **Follow the food** - Herbivores should stick to plant-rich biomes

### For Evolution

- Creatures that spread across biomes will develop different adaptations
- Population isolation by biomes can lead to speciation
- Harsh biomes select for specific traits
