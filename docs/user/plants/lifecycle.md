# Plant Lifecycle

Plants grow, reproduce, and eventually die - understanding this cycle helps you appreciate the dynamics of your ecosystem.

## The Life Stages

```
   SEED ──► SPROUT ──► GROWTH ──► MATURE ──► FRUITING ──► DEATH
     │        │          │          │           │          │
  Dormant  Emerges    Getting    Full      Producing    End of
  waiting  from soil   larger    size      seeds        life

## Seeds and Germination

### Where Seeds Come From

Seeds are produced by mature plants through:
- **Fruit production** (when conditions are right)
- **Direct seeding** (some plants drop seeds continuously)

### Germination

When a seed lands in suitable conditions:
1. Seed "wakes up"
2. Begins absorbing water and nutrients
3. Sprout emerges
4. New plant starts growing

## Growth Phase

### What Affects Growth

| Factor | Effect on Growth |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Light** | More light = faster growth (usually) |
| **Water** | Adequate water needed |
| **Space** | Crowded plants grow slower |
| **Temperature** | Must be in tolerance range |

### Growth Genes

| Gene | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `max_size` | Ultimate size the plant can reach |
| `photosynthesis` | How efficiently light is used |
| `light_requirement` | How much light is needed |
| `water_requirement` | How much water is needed |

## Mature Phase

### Energy Budget

Plants must balance their energy:

```
    ☀️ SUNLIGHT ENERGY
           │
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │ PHOTOSYNTHESIS │
    └──────┬───────┘
           │
     ┌─────┼─────┐
     │     │     │
     ▼     ▼     ▼
  Growth  Defense  Reproduction
```

### Defense Strategies

| Defense | Cost | Benefit |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Toxins** | High energy | Damages herbivores |
| **Thorns** | Moderate energy | Physical deterrent |
| **Regrowth** | Variable | Survives grazing |

---

## Reproduction

### Fruit Production

When conditions are right:
1. Plant allocates energy to reproduction
2. Fruit begins forming
3. Seeds develop inside fruit
4. Fruit ripens
5. Seeds disperse

---

## Death

### How Plants Die

| Cause | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Old Age** | Reached lifespan limit |
| **Herbivore Damage** | Eaten past recovery |
| **Environmental** | Conditions unsuitable |
