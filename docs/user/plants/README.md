# Understanding Plants

Plants are the foundation of the EcoSim ecosystem. They convert sunlight into energy, feed herbivores, spread their seeds, and evolve defenses against being eaten.

---

## What Are Plants?

In EcoSim, plants are living organisms with:

- **Genes** that control their traits (size, toxins, fruit production)
- **Growth cycles** from seed to mature plant
- **Reproduction** through various seed dispersal methods
- **Defenses** against herbivores (thorns, toxins)
- **The ability to evolve** across generations

Plants don't move (usually!), but they're far from passive.

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | What to Watch For |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Growth** | Size increasing over time |
| **Fruiting** | Plants producing fruit/seeds |
| **Defense** | Thorns, toxicity affecting herbivores |
| **Dispersal** | Seeds spreading via wind, animals, explosions |
| **Death** | Old plants dying, space for new ones |

## Try This! 🔬

### Experiment: Watch a Plant Grow

1. Find a small/young plant
2. Note its current size
3. Check back over time
4. See it grow toward maximum size!

### Experiment: Herbivore Impact

1. Find an area with many plants
2. Watch herbivores feed
3. Do plants regrow? How fast?
4. Is there a balance?

## Plant Scents 👃

Plants in EcoSim have **scent profiles** that creatures can detect:

### How Fragrant Is That Plant?

| Plant | Scent | What Creatures Smell |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 🫐 **Berry Bushes** | Strong, sweet | Delicious fruit! Attracts foragers from afar |
| 🌵 **Thorn Bushes** | Moderate | Noticeable but not overwhelming |
| 🌳 **Oak Trees** | Faint | Barely detectable, blend into forest |
| 🌿 **Grass** | None | Must be found by sight alone |

### Why Scent Matters

Strong scent is a **trade-off** for plants:
- ✅ Attracts seed dispersers (good for reproduction!)
- ❌ Also attracts hungry herbivores (gets eaten more!)

Watch for plants evolving different scent strategies based on local herbivore populations!

### What You'll See

- Creatures with good noses heading toward berry bushes they can't see
- Grass surviving because it's "invisible" to scent-trackers
- Berry bushes thriving near creatures that spread seeds after eating

## Plant Types You'll See

### By Size

| Size | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Small | Grass, ground cover |
| Medium | Shrubs, bushes |
| Large | Trees, tall plants |

### By Characteristics

| Type | Visual Clue | Notable Trait |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Standard** | Green | Basic photosynthesis |
| **Hardy** | Dark green | Resistant, slower growth |
| **Fast-growing** | Light green | Quick growth, less durable |
| **Fruiting** | With colored spots | Producing seeds/fruit |
| **Thorny** | Spiky appearance | Damages herbivores |
| **Toxic** | Darker shade | Poisons herbivores |

## Plants and the Food Chain

```
     ☀️ SUNLIGHT
         │
         ▼
    ┌─────────┐
    │ 🌱 PLANT│ ◄── Photosynthesis converts light to energy
    └────┬────┘
         │
         ▼ (eaten by)
    ┌─────────────┐
    │🐰 HERBIVORE │
    └────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼ (eaten by)
    ┌─────────────┐
    │🦊 CARNIVORE │
    └─────────────┘
```

Plants are the **primary producers** - all energy in the ecosystem ultimately comes from them.

## Plant Defense System

Plants aren't helpless! They can evolve defenses:

### Toxins 🧪

- Damage creatures that eat them
- Higher toxin = more damage
- Creatures can evolve toxin tolerance

### Thorns 🌵

- Physical damage when eaten
- Creatures need thick hide to resist
- Creates selection pressure

### Regrowth 🌿

- Fast recovery from being eaten
- "Grass strategy" - expects to be grazed
- Spreads widely despite predation

See the **[Plant Defense Genes](../genetics/genes.md)** for details!

## Coevolution with Creatures

Plants and creatures evolve together:

```
🌿 Plant evolves toxins
        │
        ▼
🐰 Herbivore evolves toxin tolerance
        │
        ▼
🌿 Plant evolves MORE toxins
        │
        ▼
🐰 Herbivore evolves MORE tolerance
        │
        ▼
      (continues...)
```

This **arms race** creates incredible diversity!

### Partnerships Can Form Too

```
🌿 Plant evolves delicious fruit
        │
        ▼
🐰 Herbivore eats fruit, moves away
        │
        ▼
💩 Seeds deposited far from parent
        │
        ▼
🌱 New plant grows in new location!
```

Both benefit - the creature gets food, the plant spreads its seeds!

## Common Questions

### Why did this plant die?

Plants die from:
- **Old age** (reached lifespan)
- **Herbivore damage** (eaten completely)
- **Environmental stress** (wrong conditions)

### Why don't plants spread to this area?

Possible reasons:
- Seeds don't reach there (dispersal limited)
- Environment unsuitable (wrong terrain)
- Herbivores eat all new plants
- No parent plants nearby

### Can plants move?

Normally no, but through evolution:
- Dormant mobility genes exist
- Rare mutations could activate them
- Theoretically possible to evolve mobile plants!
